        <p>Imagine, if you can, what the rest of the evening was like. How they <mark class="mark4">crouched by the fire</mark> which blazed and <mark class="mark1">leaped</mark> and made so much of itself in the little <mark class="mark1">grate</mark>. How they removed the covers of the dishes, and found rich, hot, savory soup, which was <mark class="mark4">a meal in itself</mark>, and sandwiches and toast and muffins enough for both of them. The mug from the <mark class="mark1">washstand<mark> was used as Becky's tea cup, and the tea was so delicious that it was not necessary to pretend that it was anything but tea. They were <mark class="mark2">warm and full-fed and happy<mark>, and it was just like Sara that, having found her strange good fortune real, she should <mark class="mark4">give herself up to the enjoyment of it to the</mark><mark class="mark1">utmost</mark>. She had lived such a life of <mark clas="mark2">imaginings</mark> that she was quite equal to accepting any wonderful thing that happened, <mark class="mark2">and almost to cease</mark>, in a short time, to find it bewildering.</p></section>

        I hope you will not think it is impolite that I should write this note to you when you wish to keep yourself a secret. Please believe I do not mean to be impolite or try to find out anything at all; only I want to thank you for being so kind to me—so heavenly kind—and making everything like a fairy story. I am so grateful to you, and I am so happy—and so is Becky. Becky feels just as thankful as I do—it is all just as beautiful and wonderful to her as it is to me. We used to be so lonely and cold and hungry, and now—oh, just think what you have done for us! Please let me say just these words. It seems as if I OUGHT to say them. THANK you—THANK you—THANK you!</section>

      <p>As far as the care of the education of her children is concerned, with its sacrifice and real application to duty, she was sometimes called--and not unadvisedly--the type of the ideal mother. From 1757 on her ideas and thoughts ran to education. Her friends were all of the philosophical trend, and intellectual labor was their chief pleasure. After having passed through a career of excitement and love's caprices, she longed for a peaceful, quiet existence; at that point, however, her health gave way, and she entered upon a new territory at Geneva. There she conquered Voltaire, who was profuse with his compliments and kindnesses. Upon her return she became the recognized leader or champion of the philosophic and foreign group and the Encyclopædists, and was regarded as the central figure of the philosophical movement in general.</p>
      <p>The ideas of the philosophers had been gaining ground, and were disseminated through all classes. The mere love of pleasure and luxury at first found under Louis XV. gave way to more serious reflections when society was confronted with those all-important questions which finally culminated in the Revolution. The salon of Mme. d'Epinay grew to be the most important and, intellectually, the most brilliant of the time. Rousseau, Diderot, Helvétius, Duclos, Suard, the Abbés Galiani, Raynal, the Florentine physician Gatti, Comte de Schomberg, Chevalier de Chastellux, Saint-Lambert, Marquis de Croixmare, the different ambassadors, counts and princes, were frequent visitors In this brilliant circle her letters from Voltaire, read aloud, were always eagerly awaited. Such dramas as Voltaire's Tancred, Diderot's Le Père de Famille, were given under her patronage and discussed in her salon; after the performance she entertained all the friends at supper.</p></section>
