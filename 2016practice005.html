          <div class="list-main">I didn't create more than one branch not to speak of merging stuff this time. But still there is something new to me: by rewriting the similar parts in diferrent stylesheets, I made a success on combing two or more separating stylesheets, and reuse the look-alike structures.This is interesting.</div>

          <div class="list-main">Last but not least is the time-controll issue. Though reusing stylesheets crossing different pages is fun, the original to-do-list is not what that matters.Besides that, indulging in comparing expiraments on the background-image settings also adds on the burden to finish the daily task. I have to bare that in mind as possible.</div>
